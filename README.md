# A Cookiecutter Template for Simple Python Projects

This is a template to generate simple Python projects that can be packaged and
installed with setuptools.

The generated projects includes the bare minimum to get a locally installable
package. If you want an advanced Python template with support for CI, tox, etc.,
this is not the template for you.
